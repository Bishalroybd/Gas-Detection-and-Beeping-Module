Gas Detection System
Project Description
A safety system that detects combustible gases using an MQ2 sensor and triggers alerts through LED indicators, buzzer, and LCD display when gas concentration exceeds safe levels.

Components Used
MQ2 Gas Sensor

Arduino Uno

16x2 LCD Display

Red & Green LEDs

Buzzer

Resistors

Breadboard

Working Principle
The MQ2 sensor detects gases like methane, LPG, and smoke. When gas concentration exceeds the threshold (400), the system:

Turns ON red LED and turns OFF green LED

Activates buzzer (1000Hz)

Displays "ALERT" and "EVACUATE" on LCD

In normal conditions:

Green LED remains ON

Buzzer stays silent

Displays "SAFE" and "ALL CLEAR"

Circuit Connections
Gas Sensor: A0 pin

Red LED: Pin 2

Green LED: Pin 3

Buzzer: Pin 4

LCD: Pins 5,6,8,9,10,11

Code Overview
Uses LiquidCrystal library for LCD interface. Continuously monitors sensor readings and triggers alerts when threshold is exceeded with 1-second delays for message display.

Applications
Industrial safety systems

Home gas leak detection

Fire safety equipment

Environmental monitoring

Learning Outcomes
LCD interfacing techniques

Sensor integration and calibration

Arduino programming

Alert system design

Industrial IoT applications
